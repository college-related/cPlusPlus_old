Abstraction
    --- Data Abstraction refers to the process of providing
        with essential information only to the outside world and
        hiding the background details.
    --- In C++, classes provides great level of data abstraction. 
        They provide sufficient public methods to the outside world 
        to play with the functionality of the object and to manipulate 
        object data, i.e., state without actually knowing how class has 
        been implemented internally.
