    **INHERITANCE**
        --- Inheritance is an important mechanism in oop. It is the
            process of inheriting the data member and methods of a 
            class to other classes.

                [syntax::
                    class A{
                        public:
                            int num;
                    }

                    //inheriting data member of class A to B
                    class B: public A{
                        // now it also has a num variable
                    }
                ]
                [ Here the class A is called as Base, super or Parent class
                  Whereas the class B is sub, or child class ]

    *** access specifier in Inheritance ***
            Rules
                1, only protected and public data member and functions
                   can be inherited.
                2, access specifier can be changed in the sub class 
                    but { public into public, protected, private } 
                        { protected into protected and private }
                        { private into private only }
