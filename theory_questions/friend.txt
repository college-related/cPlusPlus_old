    Friend Function
        --- A special type of function that can access any data 
            member and member function of a class.

                [
                    syntax:

                        class A{
                            Friend return_type function_name();
                        }
                        return_type function_name(){
                                // body code
                        }
                ] 
                [example-2]

    **benifits of Friend function
        1. It acts as the bridge between two classes by operating on their private data’s.

        2. It is able to access members without need of inheriting the class.

        3. It can be used to increase the versatility of overloading operator.

        4. It provides functions that need data which isn’t normally used by the class.

        5. Allows sharing private class information by a non-member function.

    **disadvantage of Friend function
        1. It violates the law of data hiding by allowing access to private members of the class from outside the class.

        2. Breach of data integrity.

        3. Conceptually messy

        4. Runtime polymorphism in the member cannot be done.

        5. Size of memory occupied by objects will be maximum.
