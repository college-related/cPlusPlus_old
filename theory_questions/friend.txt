    Friend Function
        --- A special type of function that can access any data 
            member and member function of a class.

                [
                    syntax:

                        class A{
                            Friend return_type function_name();
                        }
                        return_type function_name(){
                                // body code
                        }
                ] 
                [example-2]

    **benifits of Friend function
        1. It acts as the bridge between two classes by operating on their private data’s.

        2. It is able to access members without need of inheriting the class.

        3. It can be used to increase the versatility of overloading operator.

        4. It provides functions that need data which isn’t normally used by the class.

        5. Allows sharing private class information by a non-member function.

    **disadvantage of Friend function
        1. It violates the law of data hiding by allowing access to private members of the class from outside the class.

        2. Breach of data integrity.

        3. Conceptually messy

        4. Runtime polymorphism in the member cannot be done.

        5. Size of memory occupied by objects will be maximum.



    Friend class
        --- A friend class is class that is decleared friend 
            of another class and can access the private members 
            of the class too.

            [
                syntax:
                    class A{
                        public:
                            friend class B;
                    }
            ]
            [example-5]

        --- Points to remember
                1, If class B is a friend function of class A then class A
                   doesn't automatically becomes the friend class of class B.
                2, A friend function doesnot automatically becomes friend 
                    function of the derived class.
                3, Use of friend function and friend class must be limited
                    as it violates the encapusaltion and that is not good.
