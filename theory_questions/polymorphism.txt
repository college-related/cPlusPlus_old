        --- Polymorphism means having many forms. 
            Typically, polymorphism occurs when there 
            is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance.

            It can be used in c++ by the use of virtual function in
            the base class. (i.e function overriding)

    Two types of polymorphism in c++
        1, Compile-time
            {   The polymorphism achived during the compile time of the program
                is known as compile-time polymorphism.
                It is also known as static or early binding.
            
                It can be achived through function overloading and operator overloading 
            }

                     Example - 6 (function overloading)
                     Example - 7 (operator overloading)
                ]

        2, Run-time
            {   The polymorphism achived during the run time of the program i.e when the
                program is running is known as run-time polymorphism.
                It is also known as dynamic or late binding.

                It can be achived through function overriding
            }
