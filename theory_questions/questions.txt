What is --
    Inline function
        [ 
            The function that is compiled by compiler and the body code is placed
            at the calling of the function for faster execution is called Inline
            function.
            {
                 syntax: Inline return_type functionName(){
                            // body code
                        }
            }
            Usually it is a one line code and most of the function of the class are
            treated as inline function by compiler.

    class   
        [
            Class are user-defined data type that has its own data members and
            functions. It an important features of OOP and also known as the blue 
            print for an object.

    object
        [
            Object is the instance of a certain class. It can access the data members
            and functions of the class if the access is garented.

    CRC card
        [
            CRC - class responsibility collaboration is a tool used to design OOP.
                  It consists of three section class, responsibility and collaboraters.

                  -------------------------------------------------
                  |   Class Name                                  |
                  -------------------------------------------------
                  |                        |                      |
                  |    responsibility      |     collaboraters    |
                  |                        |                      |
                  |                        |                      |
                  -------------------------------------------------

                  responsibility = the action or duty the class has to do
                  collaboraters = other classes which the current class has to interact

    Ambiguity
        [
            In hybrid and nultipath inheritance there may occur a certain
            type of error when a sub class has the same function definitions
            more than one form the base class, it is called Ambiguity.

    principle of Substitutability
        [
            Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming stating that, 
            in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be 
            replaced with objects of type S (i.e. an object of type T may be substituted 
            with any object of a subtype S) without altering any of the desirable properties 
            of the program

What are -
    Types of function
        [
            4 types of function 
                1, with return and argument
                    [ return_type functionName(arg){
                        // code
                        return return_type;
                    } ]

                2, with return but no argument
                    [ return_type functionName(){
                        // code
                        return return_type;
                    } ]

                3, with argument but no return
                    [ void functionName(arg){} ]

                4, no return and no argument
                    [ void functionName(){} ]
        ]
