constructor
        --- A constructor is a special type of member function that
            initialize itslef upon creating a object of that class and
            it has the same name as the class name.

                    syntax:

                        class A{
                            A(){
                                cout << "Hello";

        --- Types of constructors
                1, default constructor
                    [The constructor which doesnot take any parameter.
                     It is mostly used for initializing data_member to 0.]
                2, parameterized constructor
                    [The constructor which takes parameter.
                     It is used to initialize data_member to certain value]

                            class A{

                                    int num;

                                        A(int a){

                                        }
                            }

                            main(){
                                A obj(2);
                            }
                    ]
                3, copy constructor
                    [The constructor which takes another obj as parameter
                     and used to copy the values of the object to another
                     object.]

                                        int num;

                                            A(){
                                                num = 2;
                                            }

                                    A ob;
                                    A ob1 = ob; // passing ob as parameter
                                }

    Q, can constructor be overloaded?
        -- Yes a constructor can be overloaded by the same concept as the
           function overloading. We can use parameterized constructors with
           different number of parameter or different type of parameter.
